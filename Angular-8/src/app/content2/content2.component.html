<h1>Takhisis</h1>
<p>Takhisis, also known as the Queen of Darkness, the Many-Headed Dragon, The Dragon of Many Colors and None, The Temptress, and the Dark Warrior, represents the godly force of control. She brings souls under her will and encourages them to grow according to her plans for conquest. She orders souls to surrender to dominance and give way to those who are stronger. She likewise orders souls to dominate others. She is the highest power among the Gods of Evil and believes that it is her right to one day dominate the entire world. Takhisis is one of the first gods, called along with Paladine. She controls the chromatic dragons and uses them for her conquests, but is always beaten back by the forces of good, evidenced by events like her defeat by Huma Dragonbane with his dragonlance. She launches the War of the Lance on Ansalon but is beaten by the Heroes of the Lance in the end. Her last great scheme, the theft of the world from the other gods, ends in failure for her as she is stripped of her godhood and slain by the elf Silvanoshei. Her celestial symbol is the constellation Many-Headed Dragon.</p>
